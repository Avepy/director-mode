# director-mode
Simple director mode wrote in TS to ALT:V

How to use?

It's really simple, u just need to enable noclip mode by pressing "L". You can modify speed, increase by pressing "Z" and decrease by pressing "X".


In director mode u can press "H" key max 10 times, at least once. Whenever u press this key, it will save your position with cam rotation (by save-point).

Next, when points are in array <1, 10>, by pressing "O" it runs smooth cam move by this points (from 1 to max).

If u want to delete actual save-points, just press "J".
